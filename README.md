# Rcommerce Project

All endpoints for the project was fully implemented in the backend (/backend), but not fully implemented in the frontend.

The Product List in the frontend, doesn't have all its functions implemented (when you hover over it). I will continue to make PRs to this repository when I can.

# Tools

This project was built using React, Redux-toolkit, React persist(to persist store states), materialUI, CSS, Styled component, NodeJS, Stripe Checkout, and Mongodb (for DB)
